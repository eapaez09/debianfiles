# DEBIAN
- I'm an Archer since ever, but I'm a little tired of cope with the usual troubles that a rolling release distro usually brings. So in order of search something more "stable" I decided to move my configs to Debian...

- Now, let's see how to install and configure it to leave as my Arch dotfiles, or at least as similar as possible:

1. [Installation](https://github.com/pzeadrian/debian/tree/main/1_Install)
2. [Build Desktop](https://github.com/pzeadrian/debian/tree/main/2_GUI)
3. [Basics](https://github.com/pzeadrian/debian/tree/main/3_Basics)
